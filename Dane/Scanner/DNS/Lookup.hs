-- | Partition the CNAMEs into those matching the desired owner, and the rest.
-- If none of the CNAMEs are pertinent, ignore them.
--
-- If exactly one matches the current qname, recurse changing the qname to its
-- target.  Since we remove the matching CNAMEs from the RR list, we're sure to
-- be loop free.
--
-- Otherwise, we have illegal multiple CNAMEs for the same owner.
--
-- Finally, return the alias chain and ultimate owner name of any answer RRset.
-- If the CNAME chain runs into an invalid multi-name RRset, the final "Maybe"
-- list will contain those names.

-- XXX: Here, we might in the future add recursion, if our iterative resolver
-- can't be relied upon to complete the recursion for us.  Except when an SOA
-- record is also included in the authority section (not currently provided)
-- covers the target of the CNAME, and no NS records in the authority section
-- signal a delegation of the target to a sub-domain.
